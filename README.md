It is a combination of:
- Mechanistic and Chemical models that require to create a differential equation for a system which one variable changes in respect to time. Solving said system: numerically, symbolically or analytically. Finally graphing numerical solution and extracting a specific value.
- Statistics, whether it is defining a non linear model or using OLS as a linear fit for data that must be imported locally. Calculating and plotting residuals of said data and discussing results.
